# Amazing Endemic Species

Amazing Endemic Species (AES) is an open-source, community-driven SaaS (Species-as-a-Service) application. AES has:

- üåç **3D Dynamic Globe**: AES maps endemic species all over the world in a 3D dynamic globe.

- üîç **Explore Endemic Species Dataset**: Dive into comprehensive endemic species information that include species classification, geographical distribution, conservation status and more details from [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) or [IUCN Red List](https://www.iucnredlist.org/).

- ü¶é **User-Friendly API Services**: AES provides easy-to-use API services, which means you can seamlessly access AES data for your scientific research or any secondary development projects.

- ‚ú® **Open-Source and Community-Driven**: Being open-source means transparency and the opportunity for anyone to improve the project. Such as, you can contribute to the database ensuring that the information is continually updated and accurate.

Join the AES community and help to map and protect the world‚Äôs endemic species! Whether you‚Äôre contributing data, using the API for your research, or simply exploring the globe, every little bit helps.

## FAQs

### What's the defination of endemic species in AES?

The defination of "endemic species" in AES refers to a species that is native
to and restricted to a specific geographical area. This area means the
country code, [ISO 3166](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166).

### Why should we pay attention for endemic species?

Endemic species are not found naturally anywhere else in the world.
These species have typically evolved in isolation over long periods,
adapting to their unique environment, and can be highly sensitive to
changes in their habitat. Endemism is significant in conservation
biology because endemic species are often more vulnerable to extinction
due to their limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements.
