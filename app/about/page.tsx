      <h2>FAQs</h2>
      <h3>What's the defination of endemic species in AES?</h3>
      <p>
        The defination of "endemic species" in AES refers to a species that is native
        to and restricted to a specific geographical area. This area means the
        country code,{" "}
        <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166">ISO 3166</Link>.
      </p>
      <h3>Why should we pay attention for endemic species?</h3>
      <p>
        Endemic species are not found naturally anywhere else in the world.
        These species have typically evolved in isolation over long periods,
        adapting to their unique environment, and can be highly sensitive to
        changes in their habitat. Endemism is significant in conservation
        biology because endemic species are often more vulnerable to extinction
        due to their limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements.
